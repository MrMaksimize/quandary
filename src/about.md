Quandary is an experiment.  It's a place to explore ideas about government, data, and analytics.  It's a place where practical solutions are applied to abstract concepts, and technology and details are not skimmed over in the fear of overwhelming someone.  

Quandary is a place to be wrong, just as often as right - as long as you fess up to being wrong.  It's a place where being wrong is encouraged - because no one everything does everything right in exploration. 

It's a place for doers, experimenters, and questioners.  It's a place for people who have questions to try new things.  It's a place for people who have too many answers.  

It's whatever the hell you want it to be.  There is one rule:  No Bullshit.
